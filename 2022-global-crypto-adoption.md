On September 14, the blockchain data platform Chainanalysis released for a third consecutive year a report covering crypto adoption around the globe. 
 

## Index

The "2022 Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index" ranks countries based on grassroot adoption. In contrast to ranking based simply on transaction
volumes, grassroot adoption reflects institutional activity as well as highlights the countries "where individual, non-professional investors 
are embracing digital assets the most". Chainanalysis

The Global Crypto Adoption Index is made up of five sub-indexes which are based on countries' usage of different types of cryptocurrency services. 
Each country is ranked according to these five metrics and the geometric mean of these rankings is taken to give each country a final score. 
The closer the final score is to 1, the higher the rank. The sub-indexes are calculated using web traffic data to estimate countries' cryptocurrency transaction volumes. 
These sub-indexes measure on-chain value received at centralized exchanges, on-chain retail value received at centralized exchanges, peer-to-peer exchange trade volume, 
wallet user share, and offline cryptocurrency payments per capita.

The sub-indexes that make up the Global Crypto Adoption Index are:

On-chain cryptocurrency value received at centralized exchanges, weighted by purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita: 
This sub-index ranks countries by total cryptocurrency activity on centralized services and weights the rankings based on the wealth of the average person 
and value of money in the country.

On-chain retail value received at centralized exchanges, weighted by PPP per capita: 
This metric measures the activity of individual, non-professional cryptocurrency users at centralized services, 
based on the amount of cryptocurrency they are transacting compared to the wealth of the average person.

Peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange trade volume, weighted by PPP per capita and the number of internet users: 
These sub-index ranks countries by their P2P trade volume and weights it based on the country's PPP per capita and number of internet users, 
to highlight countries where more residents are putting a larger share of their wealth into P2P cryptocurrency transactions.

Wallet user share: 
This sub-index ranks countries based on the estimated number of cryptocurrency wallet users relative to the country's internet population.

Offline cryptocurrency payments per capita: 
This sub-index measures the estimated number of cryptocurrency payments made offline per person in each country. 
It is intended to highlight countries where cryptocurrency is being used for everyday transactions.
