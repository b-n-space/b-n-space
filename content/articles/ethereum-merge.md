The merge and the aftermath

On September 15 at exactly 8:45 am Berlin Time, the Ethereum move to Proof of Stake occurred and run without any issues. Media around the world applauded  Ethereum for its great achievement as a leading example of turning a crypto project environmentaly friendly. The transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) also made individual investors and institutions across centralized finance (CeFi) and DeFi interested in benefiting from rewards previosuly reserved for miners. 
"In the past month, the ETH liquid staking derivatives have received a ton of attention, and titans of the industry ‚Äî including Coinbase and Frax ‚Äî have released ETH liquid staking derivatives.

Liquid staking derivatives offer all the benefits of regular ETH while also being a yield-generating asset. That means holders are able to gain exposure to ETH‚Äôs price action and maintain liquidity while harnessing staking benefits. Wallets holding stETH will see their holdings gradually increase as staking yields are regularly added to the initial sum." (Cointelegraph)

Despite all the exitement preceding the merge, almost 18 hours later, the price dropped around 17%. ETH depreciated more than most of the top coins in the week past the merge dropping below its 100dMA going towards its 200wMA. Most of the coins were gaining against ETH.

Two weeks after the merge, the price continues to fall. As far as the tech goes, staked ETH cannot be unstaked and noone knows when withdrawals of sETH will become possible. Ethereum developers first reported the update would be a part of the next hardfork, the Shenghai upgrade, which was supposed to happen in six to twelve months after the merge. At the moment the date of the update and if the withdrawal solution will be included are both ambigous. 

The upside of potential profits not only from a price increase but also via staking yield has led many users to stake ETH. Project founders from DeFi to NFT integrated stETH into their protocols. Now everyone is in blank and the ETH developers seem not prioritise adding withdrawalls in a forseeable time manner. One of them even mentioned in a Discord conversations he considers "other things that are far more critical to the longe term health of Ehthereum than stakers being able to witjhdraw in 2023 rather than 2024." . With government spending more and more time and resources to control crypto and the largest stakers being government controlled companies like Coinbase, the governmen could decide the faith of those sETH's before their owners are able to withdraw.

Ethereum catches the eye of regulators

Ether‚Äôs New ‚ÄòStaking‚Äô Model Could Draw SEC Attention. SEC chairman Gary Gensler says system used by Ether following software update could trigger securities laws.
He also noted that cryptocurrencies and intermediaries which allow holders to ‚Äòstake‚Äô their coins might pass a key test used by courts to determine whether an asset is a security.

This could be potentially detrimental to Ethereum-based projects, Presearch being one example. In general, the move while it makes Eth itself more useful as a token, especially when using liquid staking, it means projects built on Ethereum will lose their utility value.


Would users stake the project token or simply stake ETH? erasing too much value and moving it to the protocol itself might not be a great thing to attract more projects. We know DXDY moved to build on Cosmos exactly for that reason among others ofc.


Eth would suck the value of its own tokens and gain some momentum at first, but eventually, projects would want to have their own utility value so they would move somewhere else. This leads to abandoning the main chain and therefore it losing value after all.
