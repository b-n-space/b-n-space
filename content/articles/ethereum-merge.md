At exactly 8:45 am Berlin the Ethereum move to PoS occurred and it went without any issues.



Almost 18 hours later, the price dumped around 17%. ETH depreciated more than most of the top coins in the past week dropping below its 100dMA going towards its 200wMA.
At the time of writing, most coins are gaining against ETH.

Ether‚Äôs New ‚ÄòStaking‚Äô Model Could Draw SEC Attention. SEC chairman Gary Gensler says system used by Ether following software update could trigger securities laws.
He also noted that cryptocurrencies and intermediaries which allow holders to ‚Äòstake‚Äô their coins might pass a key test used by courts to determine whether an asset is a security.

This could be potentially detrimental to Ethereum-based projects, Presearch being one example. In general, the move while it makes Eth itself more useful as a token, especially when using liquid staking, it means projects built on Ethereum will lose their utility value.



Would users stake the project token or simply stake ETH? erasing too much value and moving it to the protocol itself might not be a great thing to attract more projects. We know DXDY moved to build on Cosmos exactly for that reason among others ofc.



Eth would suck the value of its own tokens and gain some momentum at first, but eventually, projects would want to have their own utility value so they would move somewhere else. This leads to abandoning the main chain and therefore it losing value after all.



It is going to be an interesting watch for sure. The thing with Presearch is pretty dangerous though. I'm not sure what can be done except for praying they find some other solution or that they don't get affected somewhow.
