The merge and its aftermath

On September 15 at exactly 8:45 am Berlin Time, the Ethereum move to Proof of Stake occurred without any issues. Media around the world applauded  Ethereum for its great achievement as a leading example of turning a crypto project environmentaly friendly. 

Despite all the exitement preceding the merge, almost 18 hours later, the price dropped around 17%. ETH depreciated more than most of the top coins in the week past the merge dropping below its 100dMA going towards its 200wMA. At the time of writing, most coins are gaining against ETH.

Two weeks after the merge, the price continues to fall. As far as the tech goes, staked ETH cannot be unstaked. There hasn't been an announcement about when this will be possible. Ethereum developers first reported the update would be a part of the next hardfork, the Shenghai upgrade, which was supposed to happen in six to twelve months after the merge. At the moment the date of the update and if the withdrawal solution will be included are both ambigous.

The upside of potential profits not only from a price increase but also via staking yield has led many users to stake ETH and also project founders from DeFi to NFT to integrate stETH into their protocols.

Ethereum catches eye of regulators
Ether‚Äôs New ‚ÄòStaking‚Äô Model Could Draw SEC Attention. SEC chairman Gary Gensler says system used by Ether following software update could trigger securities laws.
He also noted that cryptocurrencies and intermediaries which allow holders to ‚Äòstake‚Äô their coins might pass a key test used by courts to determine whether an asset is a security.

This could be potentially detrimental to Ethereum-based projects, Presearch being one example. In general, the move while it makes Eth itself more useful as a token, especially when using liquid staking, it means projects built on Ethereum will lose their utility value.



Would users stake the project token or simply stake ETH? erasing too much value and moving it to the protocol itself might not be a great thing to attract more projects. We know DXDY moved to build on Cosmos exactly for that reason among others ofc.



Eth would suck the value of its own tokens and gain some momentum at first, but eventually, projects would want to have their own utility value so they would move somewhere else. This leads to abandoning the main chain and therefore it losing value after all.



It is going to be an interesting watch for sure. The thing with Presearch is pretty dangerous though. I'm not sure what can be done except for praying they find some other solution or that they don't get affected somewhow.
