> Presearch, a decentralized search engine powered by blockchain technology, is ready for the next big step.

In less than 48 hours, Presearch will launch its mainnet, switching to a fully decentralized network run on node servers operated by the community members. 
As node operators ourselves, we have been closely following the project development over the past year and are very excited about the launch.

## When is the Mainnet launch planned?
