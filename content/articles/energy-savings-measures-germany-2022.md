## The energy-saving measures in Germany valid from 01.09.2022

Starting on September 1st, the German government introduced a set of binding energy-saving measures to prevent a shortage during the upcoming winter. The ordinance shall stay in force for six months.  


### Regulations for Public Buildings

- Passageways such as corridors, foyers or technical rooms should no longer be heated - unless there are safety-related reasons for doing so.
- Public buildings should only be heated to a maximum temperature of 19 degrees celsius. This applies when people are mainly sitting in the rooms.
There should be no hot water for washing hands in public buildings - unless this required for hygienic reasons.
- Lighting of buildings and monuments for purely aesthetic or representative reasons shall be turned off.
Illuminated advertising installations must be switched off from 10 p.m. until 4 p.m.

> Exceptions are made for clinics, hospitals, nursing homes, schools and day-care centres or other facilities where higher air temperatures are particularly necessary to maintain the health of the people staying there.


### Regulations for the private sector

- Clauses in rental agreements that require a minimum temperature are temporarily suspended.
- Landlords and utilities whose buildings are supplied with gas are to inform their tenants by September 30, 2022, about how high their energy costs could be in the coming year.
- Landlords and utilities whose buildings are served by gas are to inform their tenants by September 30 how best to save energy and how that will then affect costs.
- Private pools, whether indoors or outdoors, should no longer be allowed to be heated with gas and electricity.
- Another ordinance, which the cabinet has also approved, still needs the approval of the German Bundesrat and is to apply for two years starting from October. Among other things, it instructs mandatory annual heating inspections for buildings with gas heating systems.
 
``` "text" The second set of rules is expected to lower the gas consumption by around two percent. Economy Minister Robert Habeck from the Green Party sees it as small but necessary contribution. Germany has committed to reducing its gas consumption by 20% while in other EU countries the target lies at 15%.
