> The energy-saving measures in Germany valid from 01.09.2022


Public buildings

- Passageways such as corridors, foyers or technical rooms should no longer be heated - unless there are safety-related reasons for doing so.
- Public buildings should only be heated to a maximum of 19 degrees. This applies when people are mainly sitting in the rooms.
There should be no hot water for washing hands in public buildings - unless this is required for hygienic reasons.
- Lighting of buildings and monuments for purely aesthetic or representative reasons shall be turned off.
Illuminated advertising installations are to be switched off from 10 p.m. until 4 p.m. (B note: the time seems to be mistaken)

Exceptions are made for clinics, hospitals, nursing homes, schools and day-care centers or other facilities where higher air temperatures are particularly necessary to maintain the health of the people staying there.


## Energy-saving ordinance: The private sector

- Clauses in rental agreements that stipulate a certain minimum temperature are to be temporarily suspended.
- Landlords and utilities whose buildings are supplied with gas are to inform their tenants by September 30, 2022, about how high their energy costs could be in the coming year.
- Landlords and utilities whose buildings are served by gas are to inform their tenants by Sept. 30 how best to save energy and how that will then affect costs.
- Private pools, whether indoors or outdoors, should no longer be allowed to be heated with gas and electricity.
- Another ordinance, which the cabinet has also approved, still needs the approval of the Bundesrat and is to apply for two years from October. Among other things, it provides for mandatory annual heating inspections for buildings with gas heating systems.








## What else is coming before the Mainnet:

The gateways will be distributed geographically. Nodes are being "automatically assigned to a region based on a combination of latency and global traffic and capacity needs, with the ability to override the default region assignment if desired." Some time is expected before the traffic and rewards stabilize.

As a searcher, you may occasionally experience hiccups, such as no results found, partial results, or slow loading times. Just be patient. It's all worth it.

Our team at Bᴺ Space has been operating nodes for around a year. From our experience with the tech, we primarily learned and pretty much appreciate:

- It is quite simple to run nodes compared to other chains. Experience with setting up servers and basic knowledge of Docker will make things easier.
  - Setup process can be improved/automated with PRE nodes API (currently limited to read only)
- Different reliability score based on location. Best scores are coming from SF. Other locations however are also getting traffic.
  The hope is that with new Gateways, other locations will start receiving more traffic.
- In general search queries are increasing leading to more rewards.

As node runners, we are most excited for:

- Being part of pre community
- Provide and use decentralized and private search services
- Participate in mainnet and be an advertising router allowing for advertisers to leverage Pre capabilities
- Pre hardware that allow anyone to run a node
