the interest to buy houses dropped by large mainly because of rising mortgage rates 

 

“As recession concerns weigh on consumer outlooks, our survey shows uncertainty has made its way into the minds of many buyers,” said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com.



the most popular product today 30-year fixed mortgage increased from 3% to 6% from the beginning of this year



Higher prices and low supply

Prices are now 43% higher than at the start of covid
Supply of homes grew 27% from the last year, still not enough to cover the years-long shortage of homes
B note: most recently house construction has slowed down because of material price increase
 Homebuilders are slowing production due to fewer potential buyers touring their models
Tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve and persistently elevated construction costs have brought on a housing recession
Data shows buyers didn't disappear entirely, some are using the thinning competition and some exploring smaller markets
Home prices are cooling off -> decline of .77% from June to July. While the drop may seem small, it is the largest single-month decline in prices since January 2011. It is also the second-worst July performance dating back to 1991, behind the 0.9% decline in July 2010, during the Great Recession.
this fall sales for the housing market are dryer then usual 


Prices of realestate even in the most lucrative areas are beggining to fall. With morgage rates at ... high. Are there any parallels to 2008? 
America's pandemic price boom is over. According to Case-Shiller index, prices fell by 1.3 % in August for a second consecutive month. This was the largest drop since March 2009. 
New home sales decreased by 10.9 % in September. One of the driving factors might be the high prices of morgage when purchasing a new home. 7% rate on a 30 years 
morgage is the highest it has been in over 20 years. 

> A monthly mortgage on a median-priced home with a 20 down payment went from thirteen hundred dollars a year ago to over twenty three hundred dollars now
that's an eighty percent increase in payments. Demand for morgages is a half of what it used to be last year and at its lowest from 1997.

The recent interest rate hiking policy of Jerome and Co resulted in what we see happeening with the mortgage rates. That being said, they don;'t seem to be bothered
with the influence their actions have had on the housing market.  
In September, Jerome stated "we probably in the housing market have to go through a correction". He also mentioned the slowdown "in housing prices that
we're seeing should help bring prices more closely in line with rents and other housing market fundamentals and that's a good thing."
The thing is, FED is not slowing down anytime soon. The last meeting saw another 75 bips increase. 
The expected hike is around 4.5% - 4.7% in the Q1 2023. This was last time the case in 2007. 

Increased mortgage rates is not the only problem. The first time home buyers might experience problems collecting the first downpaymant as the surging inflation
decreases purchasing power making saving much more difficult. On the supply side, ...

The investment bank Morgan Stanley believes the house prices might fall down 7% until the next year. They also talked a bout a bull market scenario when housing
prices would decrease by 5% and a bear market one where we would see a decline of 10%. Goldman Sachs updated their last month's estimate of 1.8% rise in prices
to 5 - 10% fall. Should we get to hitting a recession, the prices might fall 20 to 25% causing lots of pain. We are not excatly at the 2008 armagedon levels
but the situation is worrying.

Canada's housing market might be one of the buggest housing bubbles in the world. Cities like Vancouver and Toronto have seen prices trippled over the past 25 years.
Several factors are diriving the prices up here; high immigration levels, increased investment demand and falling mortgage rates. Housing affordability  is a much larger issue in Canada than in the US.
In 2019 the bank of Canada dropped its benchmark interest rate to 0.25%. Property prices climbed up 17%. Bed deabts are another problematic factor. One third of all mortgaeges 
consists of varoable mortgages where the rate is fixed only at the beginning and start to fluctuate at a later point. Those who took out those seemingly good deal mortgages
are now experiencing fluctuations based on the canadian central bank raising the interest following the US FED decissions. 

Investors have to rely on rising rental rates to make up for the rising mortgage and servicing rates. Prices in Toronto are now 17% down. 

In the UK, the house prices fell down by 0.1% in August as well as in September. her Chancellor released Trussenko and her Chancelor released a way too optimistic budget without considering 
the income. The market became extremely confused. 

> ... one of the side effects of that budget was that UK government bond yields went soaring. These are the interest rates that mortgage providers
use to price their fixed rate offerings. Therefore in the wake of that chaotic budget these mortgage products were left in turmoil.

Despite the budget being pulled down and a new PM installed, the mortgae rates are slow to adhjust back and lenders are not passing on the low interest rates to those taking out the mortgages.
Home owners and potential buyers are left with uncertainty, espcecially those who took out fixed mortgages. Fixed rate mortgages in the UK are "fixed" only for the first 2 to 5 years and then they increase. 

The bank of ENglanded raised the interest rates by 75 bpt, the biggest interest rates increase in 33 years. The impact on a an average homeovner might be too much to bear. As a result
they might be forced to sell their home. In end effect, the UK house prices might fall betwenen 10 - 15% according to analysts.

The global housing market is expeting some large turbulences. The home owners starting with the US and especially Canada are epecting massive corrections. In Canada, this could mean
a situation similar to the 2008 housing bubble burst in the US. Candaian GDP would take a large hit if this was the case. There is an opportunity hidden for prpspective home owners.

In the UK, the cost of living already increased through a 10% inflation might increase further escpecially for those needing to refinance their mortgage. Let's see if the new PM can do something.
