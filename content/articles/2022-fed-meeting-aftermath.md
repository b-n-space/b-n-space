- The Nasdaq technology exchange fell by 1.8% on Wednesday

What to expect from the next FED meeting

a further increase in interest rates is expected as FED raised the interest rates by 75 basis points third time in a row

> In the future, the market will react hypersensitively to any kind of Fed commentary and data .. 

investment expert Brian Klimke of Cetera Financial

FED's priority is to fight inflation despite the economy suffering
other western CBs are undoubtedly going to continue raising interest rates as well
