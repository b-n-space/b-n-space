> The Bank of Canada has been studying Bitcoin since 2016 using surveys. The 2021 Bitcoin Omnibus Survey provides primarily information about awareness, ownership and usage of Bitcoins among Candadians. 

## Five Takeawyas from the 2021 Bitcoin Omnibus Survey

### Sharp increase of Bitcoin ownership in 2021
Ownership of Bitcoin in 2021 has seen a steep rise in 2021 after keeping under 5% from 2018 to 2020. The report also uncovered that "Purchasers used mobile apps much more than web-based exchanges, mining or visiting a Bitcoin ATM." - Bank of Canada

### About 90% of Canadians are aware of Bitcoin
Yet the survey in 2021 found that 40% of Bitcoin owners poses a low level understanding of how the asset works. This was also true for 66% of those who did not own Bitcoin.

### Purchases were largely driven by investment reasons 
Half of all owners in 2021 purchased Bitcoin in 2020 or 2021. "These recent owners are even more likely than earlier adopters to view Bitcoin as an investment vehicle." - Bank of Canada

### Most canadian Bitcoin owners hold small amounts
"In 2021, the median amount of Bitcoin held was Can$500 worth, and 70% of Bitcoin owners held the equivalent of Can$5,000 or less." Bank of Canada
Longterm owners benefited from the 2020 significant price increase and their holdings are accordingly higher in value.
