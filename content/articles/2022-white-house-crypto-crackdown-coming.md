On 09.03.2022 United States president Joe Biden Issued a first-of-its-kind executive order on Crypto directing federal agencies to coordinate their efforts in studying cryptocurrencies.

Six months later on 16.09.2022, the White House releases a "FACT SHEET: White House Releases First-Ever Comprehensive Framework for Responsible Development of Digital Assets".

> The cryptocurrency industry needs substantive proposals that aim to do more than simply mitigate potential damage. The Biden administration's framework failed to acknowledge crypto's advantages.

## Coinbureau analysis of the "FACT SHEET"

Around 16% of Americans hold crypto as a part of their personal portfolio. According to NBC news research 21% have held 
crypto has the potential to reinforce "the United States’ role in the global financial system"
also mentions potential risks, e.g. Terra crash claiming it caused 600 BLN USD damage to the crypto market in the
following month (debatable, there were other macro factors)


### Areas of the Fact Sheet

1. Protecting consumers, investors

2. Promoting financial stability

3. Countering Illicit Finance

4. US Financial System Leadership

5. Financial Inclusion

6. Responsible Innovation

Nine reports were created in total. All are focusing  
> helping cutting-edge US firms to find a foothold in global markets..

> Crypto isn't about private companies establishing global dominance. It's about developers competing between
> decentralised developers.

Crypto carbon footprint was called out in the Fact sheet. The authors are also calling on the central bank and treasury department to speed up CBDC creation and calling for the creation of an interagency working group to develop digital $ -> this is significant because the federal reserve
and the treasury department could become one institution (hypercentralisation)

## The Individual Points and Steps:

### Consumers, Investors, & Businesses Protection

> digital assets cause meaningful risks for individuals, investors and businesses

The Fact sheet focuses on volatility, lack of transparency .. They are not mentioning rewards and benefits at all. According to FBI research, scams, fraud, etc in crypto climbed 600% in 2021 than in 2020. Let's not get confused here. The crypto prices were much higher and therefore the total amount fiat money lost do due to crime increased. 
The Fact sheet doesn't present many facts and stats to support its claims!

#### Steps:

- instructs SEC (security exchange commission) and the CFTC (commodities future trading commission) to "aggressively
  pursue investigations and legal actions against crypto projects and companies"

- instruct CFPB (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and FTC (Federal trade commission) "monitor consumer complaints and
  to enforce against unfair, deceptive or abusive practices"

- CFPB is one of the organisations that were created as a part of the Dot Frank Act in 2010 (an act put together by Michael
  Bar in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Bar is Vice Chair of supervision at the FED -> this position was also
  created by the Dot Frank Act)

"address current and emerging risks in the cryptocurrency" without clarifying the "risks" instruct the FLAG (financial literacy education commission) to "help consumers understand the risks involved"

> Similarities can be seen with the IMF campaign to "educate" about CBDC and discredit crypto


### Financial inclusion

Stats: roughly 7 Million Americans have no bank account, and 24 million rely on costly non-bank services

Authors admit that some cryptocurrencies could make financial services more accessible, though more work is needed (
probably referring to stablecoins anyway).
The administration is dead set on FedNow Payment as the first step to financial inclusion - super scary - the step
includes using FedNow in the context of the distribution of disaster, emergency or other government-to-consumer payments.

> Taxation and emergency relief are how governments around the world will likely achieve the adoption of CBDCs.

Due to no competition the second step will be to instruct regulators to crack down on non-banking entities presumably
including cryptocurrency exchanges
aligning global payments practices and supervision protocols - no escape from these dystopian systems

To ensure adoption - instruct the national science foundation to research behavioural economics in fast payments -
figure out how to convince people
they expect 12% of people in the developed world to voluntarily adopt CBDCs


### Financial stability

crypto and existing financial systems becoming more connected (mostly in stable coins)

> Regulators are afraid of stablecoins because most are backed by US government debt. If they become too big and there is a run on a stablecoin issuer they could dump these treasuries assets on the open market - Using Terra UST example is silly to demonstrate how much damage crypto could do to the US financial system

The authors probably don't want to show that CBDCs are a way to subsidize government spending.

In October there will be a report about the risks! Again by an agency created by Dot Frank. It will come out at the time of
possible crypto bear market lows.

> Important to watch my video on the stablecoins report as they reference it as a starting point https://youtu.be/F27Wqgdz6fw

#### Two steps in planning

The treasury will work with financial institutions to bolster their capacity to identify and mitigate cyber
vulnerabilities "identify, track and analyse emerging strategic risks" in cryptocurrencies.


### Advancing responsible Innovation

Around half of the most valuable tech companies are based in the US (backdoor deals the companies have with the US intelligence agencies)

#### Steps

- instructs office OSTP to develop digital assets research and development agenda
  NSF will back social science and education research that develops methods develops methods of informing, educating and
  training diverse groups of stakeholders

- instruct treasury department and other financial regulators to "provide innovative US firms developing new financial
  technologies with regulatory guidance, best practice sharing and technical assistance (could be good, investors need
  clear regulations)

- To instruct various environmental regulators to "track digital assets environmental impacts, develop performance
  standards as appropriate and provide local authorities with the tools, resources and expertise to mitigate the
  environmental harms
  "Opportunities exist to align the development of digital assets with transitioning to a net-zero emissions economy and
  improving environmental justice."

> B: Will they ban PoW and base it on an unscientific justification?

- The fourth step includes ".. establishing a standing forum to convene federal agencies, industry, academics, and civil
  society to exchange knowledge and ideas that could inform federal regulation, standards, coordinating activities,
  technical assistance, and research support."
  Getting everyone on board seems likely a sign that government feels threatened by crypto.

US as the leader of the status quo of global finance as well the country’s financial competitiveness

cooperating with unelected organisations like FATF to establish global financial leadership
"US values find their way into cryptocurrency"

> Code for financial control and financial surveillance
> Instruct US various government agencies to partner with similar agencies around the world (doesn't include any mention
> about crypto)
>
> the administration will help third-world countries to develop their financial structure architecture - B: oh yeah, a
> nice way to control a larger part of the world
> help tech companies to find a place for their products on foreign markets- _Guy: for e.g. Circle providing stable coins
> for other fiat currencies, one of them the Euro_ - in the interest of the US if Circle provides Euro to countries around
> Europe - certainly in the interest of Blackrock who backs Circle 


### Illicit Activities

US pushing for KYC around the world

"While our efforts have strengthened the U.S. financial system, digital assets— some of which are pseudonymous and can
be transferred without a financial intermediary —have been exploited by bad actors..."

> All crypto is pseudonymous and doesn’t require an intermediary for movement, this goes with FATF rhetoric which
> would label every crypto transaction high-risk as it doesn't include an intermediary

Crypto is being used by bad actors for illicit purposes -> no stats for that, they know it's only 0.15% of all
transactions are related to illicit activity -> 2 - 5% of all Fiat transactions are related to the illicit activity (
despite KYC and AML) -> shows they haven't done anything in this regard in the last 30 years rather than creating
multi-billion business of compliance companies and justified government overreach

#### Steps

US politicians to expand US secrecy act to include crypto (will includeDeFi and NFT), all transactions over 10k $ have
to be reported, also peer-to-peer which they want to get rid off
also, push to raise penalties for unlicensed money transacting - going after Defi and possibly crypto wallets
Push to let department of justice prosecute digital asset crimes in any jurisdiction the victim of this crime is found

> Will the US government reach anywhere in the world?

Instruct treasury DPT to publish reports about the illicit finance risk of DeFi and NFTs end of Feb and July next year
Continue to expose and disrupt illicit actors - more sanctions
work with the private sector to understand illicit risks


### Digital $ CBDC

start talking about all the benefits
financial inclusion, cross-border payments ...
it could help preserve US financial leadership and support the effectiveness of sanctions

> No sane country will adopt it knowing the US could easily turn off its economy

"The Administration has developed Policy Objectives for a U.S. CBDC System, which reflect the federal government’s
priorities for a potential U.S. CBDC."

> The ball is already rolling, treasury department will work with FED to create CBDC.

No mention of all the downsides of the CBDS

The CBDS will give governments power to decide where how what you buy and how much you can save
borrowing will be extremely expensive, the stock market will be manipulated


## What it all means for crypto?

The current administration wants to crush crypto
2024 election! (during next crypto bull run)
a wave of regulation is coming for sure - some are reasonable, unreasonable include labelling some crypto high-risk
potentially killing the industry
Americans, inform yourselves about crypto-pro politicians (they sit on both sides)
