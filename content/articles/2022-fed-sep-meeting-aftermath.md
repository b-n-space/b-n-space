The mood on Nasdaq remained depressed after the FED decision to increase the interest rates by 75 basis points 

- Standard values coped better stabilising at lower levels
- The Nasdaq technology exchange fell by 1.8% on Wednesday
- Experts say higher interest rates particularly devalue the future profits of these high-growth companies
- S&P fell by 0.84%


## What to expect from the next FED meeting

A further increase in interest rates is expected as FED raised the interest rates by 75 basis points third time in a row.

> In the future, the market will react hypersensitively to any kind of Fed commentary and data.

<sub>Investment expert Brian Klimke of Cetera Financial for Tageschau<sub>

FED's priority is to fight inflation despite the economy suffering. Other western CBs are undoubtedly going to continue raising interest rates as well.


## Germany

On Wednesday, September 21 the leading German index DAX closed at 12,531 points, down 1.84 %.
