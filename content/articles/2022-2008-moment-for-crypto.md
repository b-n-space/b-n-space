I heard this term multiple times today only.

Bitcoin is hovering at 16.5k and everyone is in disbelief. We thought we would never ever go below 20k. All top maxis swore Satoshi that 17.5k was the bottom, but it wasn't.

Ben thinks the real ALT reckoning is happening soon. Meaning we would see ALTS bleed crazily against Bitcoin and therefore the USD.

I'm checking some TA guys and we are now casually talking about a Bitcoin range between 3k and 20k, yup! $3000 per coin! As for Ethereum, which represents the ALTs, the range would be $100 and 1k. The issue with these ranges isn't that they are low, the real issue is how long we stay in them. A couple of years to a decade, I would hear and somehow believe.

Crypto markets have never entered a recessionary period where stocks, inflation, currencies, and commodities are priced as they are today.

Miners' capitulation is a thing everyone is mentioning and they have right. Little to medium miners are losing money as of now already. Big ones already went insolvent.

The last events with exchanges exploding seems to have created a perfect scenario for crypto/stocks decoupling, the bad kind of decoupling though. Even if global markets started rallying for news like the Fed is starting to ease their rate hikes, everyone is numb about investing anything in this scamy crypto environment literally lead by criminals. We got a bad hit and we will be paying for it for years to come. The trust that we lost will be hard to recover.

The good news is: we true Bitcoiners should celebrate! Once in a life time accumulation periods will be back.

Our Bitcoin and Crypto positions are good and I'm happy about them. The coin is on a cold wallet while cosmos coins are being auto-re-staked.

We only need to start building up the cash position and diversifying it with multiple currencies. More gold and potentially some silver won't hurt. As for stocks we are good owning Bitcoin. We don't know which company is going to make it and the ETFs are in no way risk-free after everyone has poured their life savings into them over the last decade.

.....

Really tough times ahead with so many unknowns. I would not be surprised if even Cosmos VCs started going out of business should this bear continues for years, or at least if they or their clients believe so.

Looking for more stable streams of income is a high priority moving forward. That being staying in the current day job or settling in a cheap country and offering remote consultancy services.

Building our Grid and other Grand entities is tremendously valuable and would have unimaginable returns when the time is right.

To summarize the points of the next grand planning

-   Create a more conservative DCAing strategy after xxxx mark
-   Create a cash-building and preserving strategy
	- Diversify assets and wallets
-   Do risk analysis of current jobs and income streams
	- Research on potential relocation destinations and timelines
-   Make a solid plan to grow 0L and PRE businesses
-   Do a full security analysis; devices, emails, wallets, passwords, seed phrases, communication channels
	- Move to our own Grand, email servers, password managers, secure chat apps
- Relax
- Wait
- Win!
