The Bank of Canada has been studying Bitcoin since 2016 using surveys. The 2021 Bitcoin Omnibus Survey provides primarily information about awareness, ownership and usage of Bitcoins among Canadians. 


## Five Takeaways from the 2021 Bitcoin Omnibus Survey


### Sharp increase of Bitcoin ownership in 2021
Ownership of Bitcoin has seen a steep rise in 2021 after keeping under 5% between 2018 and 2020. The report also uncovered that 
> Purchasers used mobile apps much more than web-based exchanges, mining or visiting a Bitcoin ATM.

### About 90% of Canadians are aware of Bitcoin
Yet the survey in 2021 found that 40% of Bitcoin owners poses a low-level of understanding of how the asset works. This was also true for 66% of those who did not own Bitcoin.


### Purchases were largely driven by investment reasons 
Half of all owners in 2021 purchased Bitcoin in 2020 or 2021. 

> These recent owners are even more likely than earlier adopters to view Bitcoin as an investment vehicle.

### Most Canadian Bitcoin owners hold small amounts

> In 2021, the median amount of Bitcoin held was Can$500 worth, and 70% of Bitcoin owners held the equivalent of Can$5,000 or less.

Long-term owners benefited from the 2020 significant price increase and their holdings are accordingly higher in value.
