> The WSJ article discusses how Russian President Vladimir Putin receives and handles information about the war in Ukraine. 

According to current and former U.S. and European officials and a former senior Russian intelligence officer, 
Putin has built a power structure designed to deliver him the information he wants to hear, feeding into his miscalculations on the war. 

## Poorly Informed 

For example, Putin was reportedly poorly informed about the situation on the front lines in Lyman in late September, 
leading him to issue an order for troops not to retreat despite being encircled by a Ukrainian advance backed by Western artillery. 
Additionally, it is reported that Putin relies heavily on written morning briefings rather than seeking out information on the internet 
or from other sources, leading to an information bubble around him. 

Some say that the information Putin receives is filtered for him, 
with those around him seeking to protect themselves by withholding or sugarcoating discouraging data points. Others, however, 
claim that Putin has gone to lengths to get a clearer picture of the situation. The article also discusses how Putin's isolation and distrust 
has contributed to his administration's mistakes in handling the war in Ukraine, and how his conviction that Russia will succeed despite 
the sacrifices has shaped his decision-making. 

## Information Bubble

It is suggested that Putin's information bubble has developed over time, with those around him 
seeking to protect themselves by withholding or sugarcoating discouraging data points. This system of self-deception was reportedly decades in the making, 
with junior officials and senior directors knowing that to win plaudits and promotions they should exaggerate good news 
and play down the bad, for fear of upsetting "papa," a nickname for Putin. Diplomats at Russia's permanent mission to 
the United Nations in Geneva learned during Putin's two-decade rule to feed Moscow the story it wanted to hear. 
Updates relayed to the president were edited again by the Kremlin office, making it harder for him to distinguish what is correct and what isn't. 
This pattern of overconfidence and miscalculation can be seen in Russia's past military operations, such as the invasion of Georgia 
in 2008 and the seizure of Crimea in 2014. In both cases, Putin's most senior war planners advised against the actions, 
but he rejected their advice, convinced that Russia's Western enemies were seeking to pull Ukraine away from Russia's orbit. 
The article also mentions that Putin's inner circle has gradually shrunk down to his most hawkish advisers, who have assured him 
that Russian forces will succeed in their endeavors.

## Putin is not alone

There have been several examples in history where leaders have surrounded themselves with a power structure that reinforces their beliefs and biases, 
leading to miscalculations and poor decision-making. One notable example is the **invasion of Iraq** by the United States in 2003. President George W. Bush 
and his administration were heavily influenced by a group of advisers known as the "neoconservatives," who had long advocated for regime change in Iraq. 
The administration presented evidence to support their case for war that was later found to be flawed, and the invasion ultimately led to significant 
destabilization in the region and a lengthy and costly occupation.

Another example is the **Vietnam War**, in which President Lyndon B. Johnson and his administration were influenced by a group of advisers known as 
the "best and the brightest," who advocated for a military solution in Vietnam. The administration presented optimistic assessments of the war's 
progress and downplayed the challenges and difficulties, leading to a prolonged and costly conflict with significant loss of life on both sides.

In both of these examples, the leaders' reliance on a narrow group of advisers with a specific perspective led to poor decision-making and ultimately 
had serious consequences for their countries. Putin seems to be following a similar path.
